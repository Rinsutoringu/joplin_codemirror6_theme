# Release v1.0.0

## What's New

This plugin brings enhanced editor styling and productivity shortcuts to Joplin.

### Highlights

**GitHub Alerts in Editor**
Write GitHub-style alerts directly in your notes with proper syntax highlighting in the editor:
```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content requiring attention
```

**Heading Shortcuts**
Toggle heading levels instantly with `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+6`. Place your cursor on any line and press the shortcut to add or remove heading markers.

**Customizable Styling**
Every visual enhancement can be toggled on/off in settings. Don't like a particular feature? Just disable it.

**Color Customization**
Set your preferred colors for inline code and links using hex color codes.
